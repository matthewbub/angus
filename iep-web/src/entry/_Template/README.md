# Readme

This template will be a starting point for a new view within the Nextjs (Pages Router) app. To use, just duplicate it adjacent to this directory, and relative to `src/entry` you'll only need to rename the folder name. Everything else is boilerplate-level stuff. 

## Directories

- `api` - API calls for the view.
- `components` - Components specific to the view.
- `constants` - Constants specific to the view.
- `lifecycle` - Lifecycle hooks for the view.
  - `InitialServerEx` - Initial server-side lifecycle hooks.
  - `InitialClientEx` - Initial client-side lifecycle hooks.
  - `ClientObserver` - Client-side lifecycle hooks.
- `state` - State specific to the view.
