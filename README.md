# IE Portal Services

Hello and welcome to the root directory of IE Portals. This repository consists of several micro services, rest assured that at no-point in the development lifecycle are we reinventing the wheel. 

Whats UCAN?

UCAN stands for User, Content, Access, Network - the four pillars of our application. Want a fun back story? UCAN is shorten from UCAN2, originally stood for "You Can, Too." but we decided to make it an acronym instead.

### Content Watchman

The content watchman is a service that watches for changes to the content directory. When a change is detected, it will update the database with the new content. This service is required for the application to function as intended.
