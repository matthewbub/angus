# IE Portal Services

Hello and welcome to the root directory of IE Portals. We're using a proprietary configuration of Next.js, React, and Supabase to create a portal for the IE community.

# Getting Started

Check out our [Wiki](https://github.com/ninembs-studio/ieportals.com/wiki) for the technical details. ðŸ™‚

## Prerequisites

- Node.js v18.4.0 is what our team is using. We use MVN to manage node versions.
