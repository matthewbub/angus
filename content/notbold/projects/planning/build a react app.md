# With Vite
1. **Create a new Vite project**: You can use NPX (which comes with Node.js) to create a new Vite project. For a React project, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npx create-vite@latest my-react-app --template react
```

This command tells NPX to download (if necessary) and execute the `create-vite` package with the `--template react` option.
2. **Navigate into your new project directory**:

```bash
cd my-react-app
```
3. **Install dependencies**: While inside your project directory, install the necessary dependencies by running:

```bash
npm install
```
4. **Start the development server**: You can now start the Vite development server using this command:

```bash
npm run dev
```
5. **Preview your app**: Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:5000` (or whatever URL/port number was output in the terminal). You should see your new React app running.
