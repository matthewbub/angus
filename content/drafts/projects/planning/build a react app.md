# With Vite
Follow these simple instructions to create a new Vite React project from scratch:

## 1. Create a New Vite Project
Open your terminal and run the following command to create a new Vite project with a React template.
```bash
npx create-vite@latest my-react-app --template react
```
This command uses NPX to fetch and execute the `create-vite` package, specifying the React template through the `--template react` option.

## 2. Navigate to Project Directory
Execute the following command to navigate into your newly created project folder.
```bash
cd my-react-app
```
  
## 3. Install Dependencies
While in your project directory, run the following command to install required dependencies.
```bash
npm install
```
  
## 4. Start Development Server
Initiate the Vite development server by executing this command:
```bash
npm run dev
```
  
## 5. Preview Your App
- Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`.
- The URL or port number may vary; refer to the terminal output for the accurate address.
- You should now see your new React app running live.

By following these steps, you will have set up a new Vite React project, installed all the necessary dependencies, and successfully initiated the development server. You're now ready to begin building your web application. Continue your learning journey with our subsequent guides to enhance your skills further.
