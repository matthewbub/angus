**Title:** DIY Auto-Save: Building a Custom Git Bot for Markdown Files with GoLang

**Why is that title relevant?** It encapsulates the main aspects of your article - auto-saving, custom solutions, GoLang, Git bots and Markdown files. It also targets software engineers who prefer DIY or in-house software solutions over big-box solutions.

**Keywords:** "Markdown files", "auto-save", "GoLang", "Git bot", "custom solution", "DIY", "version control", "Nota.md", "monorepo", "software engineer".

**Subheadings/Sections:**

1. **An Engineer's Perspective on Writing and Backups**: Discuss your personal experience as a software engineer who enjoys writing, and how this led to the need for a more robust backup system.
    1. I enjoy writing, i also am more of a technical writer and certainly notice when a given ide has poor features. I tend to work with the cutting edge for most things - VSCode, JetBrains, Notion you name it. 
    2. I've also had the pleasruable experince of working with really bad text editors such as microsoft suite, one note omg, jira , even worse - jira on prem. There's a bunch more but the point is I find web hosted solutions to be a drag
    3. When it comes to local instances I've heard alot about writing services from the writing community themselves but nothing really provides a solid mark down user experince. Or perhaps i'm just super picky and cant find a solution i like. 
    4. The one i heard about the most from the writing community is Scrivner which of couse i had to check out for myself. It's pretty slick, kind of like.. a more GUI based text editor that feels like an IDE with its folder /file management system. However i am not a fan of the default UI. That's always a road blocker for my personal tooling and will always push me to look for alternatives. Maybe its a prombelm i have on my end, or maybe i prefer DIY! 
    5. up until about 2 years ago when i stumbled up Nota. Man, that markdown editor is great. It has an slick auto save feature and my favorite part is the flat file data managment sytem giving me full control of my data. 
    6. Trouble is, if you happen to lose access to the disk your working on wor the machine. its just gone. if you lost that folder its gone. Its happen before it will happen again. 
    7. I should also note that I had problems with Scrivner not wanting to auto-backup my content. Thats a mac os specific app, im not gonna try and fuss with it but the fact that the backup features were working made me extra nervous. 
2. **The Problem with Traditional Backups**: Talk about the limitations and potential risks of relying on traditional backup methods like local storage and cloud backups, especially when it comes to version control.
    1. other solutions dont even use regualr text documents and i strongly dislike that as someone who has to actually watch source code. 
    2. Research what other solutions use for markup
    3. its still the same problem i mentioned with nota, in most cases if you lose the backup... then what? if you loose your back up its gone
    4. Yeah, i could use Google drive or Dropbox but those services are aimed at non tech saavy users. My primary goal with alot of my stuff is to avoid the long term overhead and paying for cloud storage is gross. What happens if those cloud services go down? Not uh i'm not taking that risk. I suppose that will inherint to my preferred alternative, git x github. 
    5. There is an inherit benifit to version control, espically when used right. 
3. **Why GoLang over Node.js**: Discuss why you chose GoLang for this project, highlighting its advantages over Node.js, and how it was an opportune moment for you to explore GoLang.
    1. Im a node dev by trade, and its really easy for me to slap together an application written in Node.js.
    2. I've also been scoping Go for a while and have been looking for a reason to use it. 
    3. Node.js has a built in .watch method, but that is not something id consdier stable and is documented in several places as being untrustworthy so i figured that to be a red flag right away
    4. There are some thrid party packages that solve the problem of nodejs built in watch method but by the time i had stumbled up those i was already exploring go as a possible alternative. I do not regret choosing Go, it really felt like it was built for this sort of thing more so than my first alternative.
    5. I wonder if there was possibly an even better tech to implement this? Do you have suggestions?
4. **Building a Local Git Bot for Auto-Saving**: Detail your vision for the bot, its ability to watch a given directory for changes and auto-commit on your personal machine. Discuss why you opted to use Git and a dedicated bot for these automated commits.
    1. 
5. **Integrating the Git Bot into a Monorepo Environment**: Share the challenges and considerations when integrating the bot within a monorepo, emphasizing the importance of targeting only specific directories.
6. **A First-Timer's Experience with GoLang**: Reflect on your initial experiences with GoLang, comparing and contrasting it with JavaScript. Discuss how you found GoLang's opinionated nature and its impact on the development experience.
7. **Conclusion: A DIY Approach to Auto-Saving**: Share insights on how your custom Git bot enhances the security and reliability of markdown file backups. Highlight its potential benefits for other software engineers who prefer DIY solutions.
