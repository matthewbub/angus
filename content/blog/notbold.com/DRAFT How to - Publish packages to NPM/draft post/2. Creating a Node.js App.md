This tutorial will presume you already have Node.js installed on your machine. Ideally, you'll be running on a version v14.2 or greater. As of this writing, i'm working with v18.4. (I'll be sure to revisit this article should that change)

## Node.js & NPM
Here's some frequently asked questions surrounding the topic of NPM that we've all had at one point or another. ðŸ˜† 

### What is Node.js?
Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that enables developers to write code on the server. Its non-blocking, event-driven architecture makes it highly efficient and lightweight. Node.js is build on top of a single language (JavaScript), which helps promote a more efficient development processes. 

Node.js offers a huge ecosystem providing developers with access to hundreds of thousands of reusable packages via NPM, making collaborative projects easier and quicker to complete. Node.js is well suited for real-time applications such as chat and gaming apps, allowing changes made by other users to be seen in real time. It would be safe to say that Node.js has revolutionized the way server-side coding is done streamlining the process of creating powerful web applications.

## How Do I Figure Out Which Version of Node.js I'm Using?
Finding out which version of Node.js you're using is like checking the "Best Before" date on a milk carton, but for your code. The quickest way to identify your Node.js version is via the Node.js CLI (Command Line Application).  If Node.js is installed and set up correctly on your computer, then you should be able to identify the version number. 

Here's how you can check your Node.js version number:

1. Open your terminal.
2. Type in `node -v` and hit the Enter key.

Your terminal should then spit out something like this:

```shell
node -v
# v18.4.0
```

That `v18.4.0` is the version of Node.js you're running. Now you know which version of Node.js is powering your code.

## How would I know if I need to Update My Node.js Version?
Determining when to update your Node.js version is often a nuanced decision. There are several factors that come into play, each with its own level of urgency. If you're working within a team, aligning your Node.js version with your teammates' is something that most would consider worth the effort. Failing to do so could lead to discrepancies in your development environment and result in non-sensible errors and warnings, not necessarily from your own code but also from third-party packages that your project relies on.

If you're steering your own ship or get to call the shots on versions, here are some key points to weigh:

### Deprecations
Deprecation warnings often surface in the console or terminal, providing some runway before they become breaking changes or are completely removed in new versions. 

To mitigate the risk of deprecations turning into crises, keep an eye on the packages you rely on. If one of your core dependencies is an open-source project, consider subscribing to updates from its public repository. Side note: contributing to the community could also be beneficialâ€”your input and perspective are valuable assets.

### Vulnerabilities
Scanning for vulnerabilities in third-party code is not something that should be considered optional; it's more of a necessity. While this is an expansive subject that can't be fully covered here, tools like GitHub's Dependabot or specialized Code Security Analysis software can help keep your codebase secure. 

While I may not invest significant effort into continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) under the Pareto Principle, ensuring security is non-negotiable.


- **Compatibility issues & Project Requirements** - Generally speaking; if you find your self needing to mix and match different versions of 3rd party dependencies to get them to work in harmony, you probably should be looking for more modern and up-to-date solutions. There are exceptions to this however; Exceptions being the maintenance of existing applications where it wouldn't be feasible to simple update to the latest stable versions. You've also got to watch out for those shiny new features as well; a prefect example being Next.js' App router in V13.2. These errors have a high change of being ambiguous like the rest of the versioning related errors we've mentioned so far. 


## Getting Started
Let's start by creating a new nodejs project. You can give it any name you'd like, i'll be calling mine `@ucan/ui-box` because that's the repo.
