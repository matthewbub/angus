# Creating a Node.js App
1. Explanation of what Node.js is and why it's important for web development.
2. Step by step process on how to create a basic Node.js app.
3. Guide on how to test and confirm if the app works properly

This tutorial will presume you already have Node.js installed on your machine. Ideally, you'll be running on a version v14.2 or greater. As of this writing, i'm working with v18.4. (I'll be sure to revisit this article should that change)

## Node.js & NPM Versioning FAQ
Here's some frequently asked questions surrounding the topic of NPM that we've all had at one point or another. ðŸ˜† 

### How do I find my Node.js Version Number?
The quickest way to identify your Node.js version is via the Node.js CLI (Command Line Application). If you have Node.js installed on your machine, and it is configured properly, then you should be able to print the version of Node.js you have on your machine by executing the `node -v` command from within a terminal. 
```shell
node -v
# v18.4.0
```

### How would I know if I need to Update My Node.js Version?
It's going to be a case by case bases, but of course we can dive into it deeper than that. If you are working as a member of a team, it's likely that you'll want to lock into which ever Node.js version they're using, otherwise you'll risk creating an environment that does not run parallel with your peers. As a result, you may encounter nonsensical errors and warnings coming from your code or the 3 party code associated with your projects dependencies. 

If you're working on a personal project, or if your the one who get's to make the final call for versions, some things you'll want to consider are: 
- Deprecations - These are usually identifiable as console/ terminal warnings up-until they break or are removed from new versions entirely. Generally speaking you can mitigate the risk of app-breaking deprecations by staying up-to-date with what's happening in the packages your using. If you have a core package that your app depends on, and it's open sourced on a public repository, consider subscribing to that repository for updates. Also, don't be afraid to contribute to the community as they would surely appreciate the help, or at least the second set of eyes.
- Vulnerabilities - There are a lot of automated tools that help scan your projects for vulnerabilities in 3rd party source code. This is a huge topic and beyond the scope of what we can cover here, but if you're interested in learning more check out the Dependabot section of your GitHub Repository or spend some time researching Code Security Analysis tools. Personally, I don't spend much time working with CI/CD when considering the 80/20 rule. Although I do find it entertaining.
