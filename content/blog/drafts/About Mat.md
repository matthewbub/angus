**About Matthew**

Hi there! My name is Matthew, I’m a Software Engineer by trade and the voice behind this blog. I bring with me, years of hands-on experience in a field that is continuously evolving. My hope for Not Bold is to cultivate a unique blend of technical proficiency and storytelling based on the experiences of myself and others in the field.

Like so many of the awesome engineers I work with today, I am what the industry tends to refer to as, “Self Taught” in the sense that I did not receive a formal education for the skills I’ve aquired throughout my career. My path was less traditional but doesn't feel all that special to me.

I spent time learning in online programs, networking with other aspiring engineers, seeking mentorship. I wrote a countless amount of software applications in my free time. Even writing portions of software applications on my phone’s notepad when I couldn’t be at my desk. Eventually, I would go on to land a part-time role as a teaching assistant for the niche field of full stack web development, a 6 month program presented by UCLA and EdX (formerly known as 2U).

While my passion for software engineering grew throughout that time, I also realized another passion. I mean, that was my first foot in the door to a world outside of blue collar work and it really lit a candle inside me and paved a path forward. For example, this opportunity eventually led to my full time career as a software engineer, and several opportunities associated. Another example.. wait, actually - come to think of it, I could bore you all day with fond memories of what I did yesterday. The primary point I’m trying to convey, is I learned that I love to help you.

Why I started Not Bold

When I was young my aunt used to get me these adventurous books that would take me on the wildest rides. I was the kid who would read my book by flashlight under the covers as a kid. I just found words so fascinating. As it would seem and to this day, I have found no skill or trade that brings me as much joy as those that involve the crafting and manipulation of the english language.
