1. intro
    1. why are we doing this
      This tool is intended for writing, actually. A lot of folks prefer Scrivener, but I prefer a simpler approach, if thats what we could call this. Also, I think this is more reliable than Scriveners backup feature that is supposedly supposed to be a lifesaver. I'd not the type to jump on a bandwagon, or maybe I am and I'm just really techy. But I just don't see much benefit in using Scrivener. I create my own compositions in markdown and distribute my content from there. In most places I'm publishing, markdown is the preferred format. Just like how I don't use WordPress. My reasoning behind that is because I am confident in my ability to build a more secure system. So, I'm just going to stick with that.
