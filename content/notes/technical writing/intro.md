# A Comprehensive Guide to Technical Writing

Technical writing is a skill that involves communicating complex information in an easy-to-understand manner. It is not meant to evoke emotion in the reader, but rather to inform, instruct, or persuade. There are different levels of tech writing, ranging from writing for experts to writing for a lay audience or multiple audiences. Regardless of the audience, the message should always provide knowledge or instructions, and the format should be single-spaced, as short as possible, and in a business format (email, memo, report, etc.). The ultimate goal of tech writing is to clarify information for the reader.

## The Importance of Plain Language

Plain language in technical writing refers to clear, concise, and straightforward writing that is easy to understand. It avoids jargon, complex sentences, and unnecessary details. The goal is to communicate information effectively, ensuring the reader can understand and act upon the information after a single reading. It's about empathy for the reader, making sure the language, structure, and design are user-centered. Plain language is essential in technical writing to make complex concepts and procedures accessible to all readers, regardless of their technical knowledge or expertise.

    - What do they know? What do they do?
    - Why do they need this info?
    - What do they need to do after getting this info?
    - What are the factors that influence their response?
    - Are they higher-ups, lower-level employees, team members, or outside the organization?
    - Your purpose should be to inform, persuade, and be interesting.
    - Specify your purposes.

2. Decide what needs to be said.
3. Choose the most appropriate format (email, letter, report).

### Drafting

1. Create a first draft, focusing on content rather than fine points of mechanics, style, and tone.

### Rewriting

1. Consider the organization of the content.
2. Check for accuracy, completeness, and ethical validity.
3. Revise for style, striving for concision and simplicity.
4. Adjust the tone to suit the audience.

By following these steps and keeping the audience in mind, technical writing can be a powerful tool for communicating complex information in an accessible and user-friendly manner.
