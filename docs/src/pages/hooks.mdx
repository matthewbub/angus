# Hooks

We have a number of custom hooks that are available for use in tenant apps. These hooks are designed to make it easier to work with the UCAN2 API and to provide a consistent experience across tenant apps.

## `useRCIfNonEmptyString`

<Note>
  Only available in tenant apps. 
</Note>

The `useRCIfNonEmptyString` hook is a custom hook that provides a function for conditionally rendering a component based on a translated string value. This is the primary hook we use for localization in tenant apps. 

If you need a more custom usecase, you can use the `useTranslation` hook directly. Read the [i18next documentation](https://www.i18next.com/overview/api) for more information.

      <Property name="value" type="string">
        The translation key for the string.
      </Property>
      <Property name="component" type="JSX.Element">
        The component to render with the non-empty string.

    ```jsx {{ title: 'Basic Usage' }}
    import { useRCIfNonEmptyString } from '@/lib/useRCIfNonEmptyString';

    function MyComponent() {
      const useRCI = useRCIfNonEmptyString();

      return (
        <>
          {useRCI('translation.key', (value) => (
            <p>{value}</p>
          ))}
        </>
      );
    }
    ```
