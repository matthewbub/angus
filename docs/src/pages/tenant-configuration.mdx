# Tenant Configurations


<Note>
The configuration file is located in the `src` directory of each tenant. The configuration file is named `tenant.config.js`.
</Note>


Each tenant has its own configuration file, each configuration file has the same key values. The configuration file is a JavaScript object that contains propetires used to configure the application. 

This could be considered the source of truth for the tenant and serves a wide range of purposes from controls, localizations, in-app links. If the tenant needs a label change, we'd change the applicable property in the configuration file. Maybe the tenant doesn't want to use a certain feature, we'd change the applicable `ignore` property to `true`.

It's worth mentioning we generally aren't handling theming here. Most of that is ahppening in the tenants `tailwind.config.js` file.

    <Properties>
      <Property name="name" type="string">
        The tenants organizational / legal name.
      </Property>
      <Property name="slogan" type="string">
        The tenants slogan.
      </Property>
      <Property name="logo" type="string">
        The tenants logo. This is generally defined in the `src/tenants/<tenant>/src/components/Logo.jsx` file but we keep it here for reference.
      </Property>
      <Property name="messages" type="object">
        Localized messages used throughout the application. When starting a new tenant, only use the `en` locale. Once the tenant is ready for localization, we'll send the applicable locale to professional translation services. Read more about how to utilize the `messages` property in the [Hooks](/hooks#use-rc-if-non-empty-string) section.
      </Property>
      <Property name="links" type="object">
        Links used throughout the application.
      </Property>
      <Property name="ignore" type="object">
        Properties that should be ignored. This is useful for hiding features that the tenant doesn't want to use.
